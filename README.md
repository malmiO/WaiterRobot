## The features of the robot.

### Avoiding obstacles

#### Any object lying in the robot's route is detected by an ultrasonic sensor, and the sensor's output is used to modify the wheels' orientation so that the robot may continue its path while avoiding the object.

### Line following 

#### When it comes to line following, the robot's job is to follow a predetermined path, which is indicated by a black line. The robot's two strategically placed infrared sensors work together to support this. These sensors detect variations in the intensity of reflected light by emitting infrared light.


### Display

#### LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen is fixed to the face of the robot. This display has two purposes: it not only provides pleasant and helpful messages to improve the user experience, but it also alert anybody that is blocking its way.

### Serving

#### One of the main features of this robot is serving food to the customers. The servo motors used in the arms of the robot will help the robot to serve the food on the serving tray to the customer
